Overview
========

Summary
-------
(The Warhawk. Small. Fast. Deadly.)

I wanted a ship that wasn't labyrinthine on the inside but still had room for crew, could survive combat, and looked good. Result? The Warhawk. This ship is relatively small at only ~45 meters long (the Frontier is ~39 meters), and ~40 meters wide, but still manages to have a crew berthing area, a captain's quarters, a workshop, a small shielded cargo hold, and a jammer.

The Warhawk is a class B ship with top of the line components, including a Dogstar Mag Intertial 104DS reactor, a Deep Core Aurora 13G grav jump drive, and Reladyne White Dwarf 3015 engines. Weaponry includes 2 full compliments of particle weapons (3x Light Scythe Exterminator 95MeV Helion Beams and 4x Ballistic Solutions Inc. PB-175 Helion Beams), and 1 full compliment of EM weapons (4x Light Scythe Nullifier 1750 Suppressors) to disable hostile ships if needed.

Available at New Atlantis Ship Services once the inventory refreshes after you've hit level 50.

Upgrading
---------
When upgrading non-major versions (for example v2.something to v2.something-else), you don't need to do anything except replace the installed mod files.

When upgrading major versions (for example v1.whatever to v2.whatever), you need to do a clean install:
- Open the game and load your latest save
- Save your game, then quit
- Uninstall the previous version of the plugin and all its files
- Open the game and load your last save
- You will see a warning about missing the plugin you just uninstalled, choose to continue
- Save your game again, then quit
- Install the new version of the plugin

Mod Manager
-----------
Download and install the archive with either [Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases) (version 2.5.0 or later) or [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1). I personally recommend Mod Organizer 2 (with the optional [Root Builder](https://kezyma.github.io/?p=rootbuilder) plugin to use with SFSE or any other mod that requires files be put directly in the game's installation folder).
