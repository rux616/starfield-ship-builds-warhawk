Version: 1.1.0

Summary
-----
I wanted a ship that wasn't labyrinthine on the inside but still had room for crew, could survive combat, and looked good. Result? The Warhawk. This ship is relatively small at only ~45 meters long (the Frontier is ~39 meters), and ~40 meters wide, but still manages to have a crew berthing area, a captain's quarters, a workshop, a small shielded cargo hold, and a jammer.

The Warhawk is a class B ship with top of the line components, including a Dogstar Mag Intertial 104DS reactor, a Deep Core Aurora 13G grav jump drive, and Reladyne White Dwarf 3015 engines. Weaponry includes 2 full compliments of particle weapons (3x Light Scythe Exterminator 95MeV Helion Beams and 4x Ballistic Solutions Inc. PB-175 Helion Beams), and 1 full compliment of EM weapons (4x Light Scythe Nullifier 1750 Suppressors) to disable hostile ships if needed.

Available at New Atlantis Ship Services once the inventory refreshes after you've hit level 50.
